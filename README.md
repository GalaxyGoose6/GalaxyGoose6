- 👋 Hi, I’m @GalaxyGoose6
- 👀 I’m interested in AutoCAD, 3D Printing, Coding, Networking, Servers, Open Source Software, Operating Systems, and General Computer Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AutoCAD.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a plethora of different open source and moddable computer cases.
- 📫 You can reach me by phone number at (724)-584-4888, my email XXXXX, or my Discord at GalaxyGoose6
- ⚡ Fun fact: I went to nationals, for wrestling in high school, and for those of you thinking about "The Rock", its not that kind of wrestling.
- For anyone interested, I have a few different Discord servers started, that will be primarily focused on the projects I am trying to start developing.
- If you would like the files, to help with projects, make/design your own mods, or just enjoy the final product, please don't hesitate to reach out.
- I look forward to hearing from you all
- Goose
